# Signer Guides

Step-by-step guides that take you from initialization to a signed transaction for each chain. Read [Request Basics](/en/hardware-sdk/core-api-guide#request-basics) first.

## Structure

- Prerequisites: firmware/SDK versions, required transport, device confirmation
- Step flow: connect → choose account path → build request → confirm on device → verify result
- Minimal runnable sample: event listeners, request params, result validation
- FAQ: wrong path, reject/timeout, network or data issues

## Quick checklist (read before any signer)

- Environment & versions: latest firmware + aligned SDK/Bridge; pick the transport guide for your platform.
- Paths: use chain-specific HD paths; double-check hardened vs non-hardened (see each signer page).
- Session & wallet: most chain methods need `connectId + deviceId` (BLE requires `deviceId`); `deviceId` changes after reset; include `passphraseState` for hidden wallets.
- UI: subscribe to `UI_EVENT`; handle PIN/passphrase prompts with `uiResponse`.
- Verify result: always check `success` then validate the returned address/signature with chain libs.
- Safety: reject on unexpected prompts, and fail fast if device is in Bootloader.
