# Signer Guides

Step-by-step guides that take you from initialization to a signed transaction for each chain. Read [Request Basics](/en/hardware-sdk/core-api-guide#request-basics) first.

## Structure

- Prerequisites: firmware/SDK versions, required transport, device confirmation
- Step flow: connect → choose account path → build request → confirm on device → verify result
- Minimal runnable sample: event listeners, request params, result validation
- FAQ: wrong path, reject/timeout, network or data issues

## Available guides

- [EVM Signer](./evm) — paths, EIP-1559 vs Legacy params, device prompts, post-sign broadcast
- [BTC Signer](./btc) — script/path matrix, refTx completeness, change/output review, serialization
- [Solana Signer](./solana) — fixed hardened path, raw message/tx prep, signature assembly
