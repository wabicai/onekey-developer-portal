# Signer Guides

Step-by-step guides that take you from initialization to a signed transaction for each chain. Read [Request Basics](../api-reference/request-basics) first.

## Structure

- Prerequisites: firmware/SDK versions, required transport, device confirmation
- Step flow: connect → choose account path → build request → confirm on device → verify result
- Minimal runnable sample: event listeners, request params, result validation
- FAQ: wrong path, reject/timeout, network or data issues

## Available guides

- [EVM Signer](./evm) — EIP-1559/Legacy signing and verification
- [BTC Signer](./btc) — UTXO building, refTx handling, signing output
- [Solana Signer](./solana) — Fixed path and serialized transaction signing
