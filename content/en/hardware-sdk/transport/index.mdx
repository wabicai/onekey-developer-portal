# Transport Overview

Transport is the communication layer between your application and OneKey hardware devices. Choose the right transport based on your platform and connection method.

> If the standard transports do not fit (e.g., custom hardware channel), skip to **Advanced Topics** for low-level plugins and the message protocol.

## Connection Methods

OneKey devices support two primary connection methods:

| Method | Connection | Supported Devices |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **USB** | Wired via USB cable | All OneKey devices |
| **Bluetooth** | Wireless via BLE | OneKey Pro, OneKey Touch |

## Choose Your Transport

Use this decision matrix to select the appropriate transport for your project:

| Platform | Recommended Transport | Package |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Web Browser** | [WebUSB](./web-usb) | `@onekeyfe/hd-common-connect-sdk` |
| **React Native** | [React Native BLE](./react-native-ble) | `@onekeyfe/hd-ble-sdk` |
| **Android (Native)** | [Android Native](./android) | Low-Level Transport Plugin |
| **iOS (Native)** | [iOS Native](./ios) | Low-Level Transport Plugin |
| **Flutter** | [Flutter Native](./flutter) | Low-Level Transport Plugin |

## Web Development

### WebUSB

For web applications running in Chrome/Edge browsers. Connect via USB cable.

- Requires HTTPS
- User gesture required for device authorization
- No native dependencies

[Get Started with WebUSB](./web-usb)

## Mobile Development

### React Native BLE

For React Native applications. Uses the `@onekeyfe/hd-ble-sdk` package with native BLE modules.

- Pure JavaScript SDK with native transport
- Supports iOS and Android
- Requires Dev Client build (not Expo Go)

[Get Started with React Native BLE](./react-native-ble)

### Native Platforms (Android / iOS / Flutter)

For native applications that don't use React Native. These guides are **examples built on the Low-Level Transport Plugin**, bridging the JavaScript SDK with native Bluetooth via WebView + JS Bridge. Read the Low-Level Transport Plugin first, then follow the platform example.

Architecture: **WebView + JS Bridge + Native BLE**

| Platform | Guide | Demo |
|----------|-------|------|
| Android | [Android Native](./android) | [native-android-example](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/hardware-js-sdk/tree/onekey/packages/connect-examples/native-android-example) |
| iOS | [iOS Native](./ios) | [native-ios-example](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/hardware-js-sdk/tree/onekey/packages/connect-examples/native-ios-example) |
| Flutter | [Flutter Native](./flutter) | - |

## Low-Level Transport Plugin (includes Message Protocol)

If standard transports don't fit or you need native host integration, start here. It defines the custom transport contract and the 64-byte USB/BLE framing.
