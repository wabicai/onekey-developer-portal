# PIN

How to handle PIN entry on OneKey devices with recommended UX.

## Essentials

- Protected calls trigger `UI_REQUEST.REQUEST_PIN` when the device is locked.
- Pro/Touch require on-device PIN entry; other models allow blind PIN but on-device is preferred.
- Close the prompt after `ui-close_pin_window` or a success event.

## Support matrix (software blind PIN)

| Device | Software Blind PIN | Device-only Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OneKey Classic / 1s / 1s Pure / Mini | Supported | No |
| OneKey Touch | Not supported | Yes |
| OneKey Pro | Not supported | Yes |

## UI design notes

- Single dialog with two actions: **Enter on device** (default) and **Enter here (blind PIN)**.
- Blind PIN keypad is a fixed 3x3 layout; never echo real digits.

### Blind PIN mapping example

```ts
const BLIND_KEYBOARD_MAP = ['7','8','9','4','5','6','1','2','3'];
// label is 1..9
HardwareSDK.uiResponse({
  type: UI_RESPONSE.RECEIVE_PIN,
  payload: BLIND_KEYBOARD_MAP[label - 1],
});
```

## Events to responses

```ts
import { UI_EVENT, UI_REQUEST, UI_RESPONSE } from '@onekeyfe/hd-core';

HardwareSDK.on(UI_EVENT, (msg) => {
  if (msg.type === UI_REQUEST.REQUEST_PIN) {
    HardwareSDK.uiResponse({
      type: UI_RESPONSE.RECEIVE_PIN,
      payload: '@@ONEKEY_INPUT_PIN_IN_DEVICE',
    });
  }
});
```
