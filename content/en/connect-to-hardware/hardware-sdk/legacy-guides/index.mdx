# Legacy Migration Guides

These guides help you migrate from legacy Bridge-based integrations to modern WebUSB connections.

## Available Guides

- [Bridge to WebUSB (hd-common-connect-sdk)](migrate-bridge-to-common-connect-webusb) - Recommended migration path using `@onekeyfe/hd-common-connect-sdk`
- [Bridge to WebUSB (hd-web-sdk)](migrate-bridge-to-webusb) - Migration guide keeping `@onekeyfe/hd-web-sdk`

## Which Guide Should I Use?

- **New projects**: Use `hd-common-connect-sdk` (no iframe dependency)
- **Existing projects with hd-web-sdk**: Choose based on your preference - either migrate fully to `hd-common-connect-sdk` or keep using `hd-web-sdk` with WebUSB transport
