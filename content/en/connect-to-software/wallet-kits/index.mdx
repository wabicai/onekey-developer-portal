# Support Wallet Kits

If your project already uses a wallet aggregator/kit, you can keep using it and prioritize OneKey in their configuration. The following popular kits support OneKey:

- [Web3 Onboard (EVM)](./web3-onboard)
- [RainbowKit (EVM)](./rainbowkit)
- [Web3Modal (EVM)](./web3modal)
- [Aptos Wallet Adapter (Aptos)](./aptos-wallet-adapter)

For pure web without aggregators, see: [Web (Injected Provider)](../provider/README).
