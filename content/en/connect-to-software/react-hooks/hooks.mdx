# React Hooks

Type-safe React hooks for Ethereum. Build your own custom wallet connection UI with full control over the user experience.

<Callout>
**Best for custom UIs.** Use React Hooks when you want to design your own wallet connection flow.
</Callout>

## Available Libraries

| Library | Description |

## When to Use

Use React Hooks when you:
- Need full control over the wallet connection UI
- Want type-safe hooks for Ethereum interactions
- Are building a React application
- Don't need a pre-built wallet selection modal

---

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect } from 'wagmi'
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

function ConnectButton() {
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount()
  const { connect } = useConnect()
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect()

  if (isConnected) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{address}</p>
        <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: injected() })}>
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  )
}
```
