# Provider API

Build a wallet connection that feels native. The Provider API is OneKey’s unified interface for dApps, giving you a consistent way to request accounts, sign, and send transactions across multiple chains.

## What this gives you

- **One interface, many chains**: Keep a single integration flow while supporting EVM, Bitcoin, Solana, and more.
- **Wallet‑ready UX**: Works seamlessly with UI kits like Web3Modal for a clean connect experience.
- **Production‑grade**: Standardized methods and events to reduce edge cases across wallets and networks.

## Supported Chains

- **EVM**: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.
- **Bitcoin**: BTC, Lightning Network (WebLN)
- **Solana**: SOL
- **Cosmos**: ATOM and Cosmos SDK chains
- **Move**: Aptos, Sui
- **Others**: TON, TRON, Polkadot, Cardano, Algorand, Conflux, NEAR, Nostr
